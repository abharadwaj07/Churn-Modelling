# Churn-Modelling

## The objective of this project is to create a Churn model for a bank based in Europe

This is achieved by training an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) with 2 hidden layers over 100 epochs. This model has an accuracy of around 87%.

This trained model can also predict the probability of a new customer exiting the bank.
